# covid-python
This program has the intention to draw a graph using turtle method.
Given 2 lists in a text file, the first one represents the new cases of covid during a timeline and the second one represents the tests made. 
The program is making a graph with the daily cases, tests, and the percentage of new cases versus the tests done.
In order to have the graph on the window, each of thes graphs were scaled:
- new cases scaled by thousands
- tests scaled by 300
- percentage scaled by 1000 instead of 100, to have a better visibility
